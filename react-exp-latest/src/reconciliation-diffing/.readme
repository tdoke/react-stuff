1] how DOM works.  === done
2] how browser interprets DOM === done
4] how react component is converted to a tree of react elements
5] what is virtual dom and how it is built from tree of react elements
6] what happens when setState is called on a container / props passed
     to a component change
7] how reconciliation works

reconciliation starts when ReactDOM.render is called or .setState is called in a component, it works in 2 parts
 part 1] build or change virtual dom tree by traversing the tree of react elements generated from root component
 part 2] compare virtual dom with previous virtual DOM find differences
 part 3] commit differences found in step 2] to real DOM.

 optimization: reduce the number of (un necesssary) differences between current virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM

How react works
1] when setState is called on a component or ReactDom.render is called, React rebuilds the DOM tree under it , there by creating new virtual DOM 
2] how react creates virtual DOM tree (https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html)
3] this created virtual DOM is a tree of primitive react elements.
4] this new virtual DOM is compared with old virtual DOM, process called as diffing, reconciliation
5] diffing has 2 rules 
5.1] nodes are compared through BFS
5.2] if two nodes are mismatching , entire subtree is replaced by new nodes
5.3] while comparing lists react relies on key to find differences between two lists
6] react pushes result of diffing to real DOM.
