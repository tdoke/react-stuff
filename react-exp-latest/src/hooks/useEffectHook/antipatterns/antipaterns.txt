1] doing change detection of state, prop in useEffects dependency array,
   and modifying components state inside same effect.
2] Adding objects to useEffects dependency array instead of primitives.
3] cyclical looping of multiple useEffects in same component.
useEffect(() => setA(), [B, C])
useEffect(() => setD(), [A])
useEffect(()=> setE(), [D])

remedies:
1] To move each useEffect to its own custom hook.

2] To use useMemo, instead of useEffect.
3] To use usePrvious hook to keep track of previous values of state/prop.
4] I have had the mindset of "if you can do it without useEffect then try that first. Its its a 
living nightmare, then resort back to useEffect.
5] Not sure about what you're asking here, but this isn't a new discovery. There is an entire page on 
the official new React docs dedicated to teaching developers to rely on useEffect only as an 
"escape hatch" due to its tendency to be a code smell

https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect

Also, last year's "Goodbye, useEffect: David Khourshid" conference talk basically outlined most 
of your discoveries, emphasizing to rely on events + callbacks over effects for cleaner code. Which 
unsurprisingly, many people took issue with (nobody likes hearing years of react code they've built is wrong)

So when should you use an Effect then?

Treat is as a synchronization tool. Or more specifically, one you are forced to use to synchronize 
some piece of React code with some piece of external or third party system that does not offer an 
event-driven or "react-friendly" way of doing things.

7] if effect is result of any user action / dom event, then handle it in event handlers without using any useEffect hook.
eg. on submit btn click, save form to backend

8] when you need to synchrnize component with externl system or widget, where no user action / dom event is invoved.
in that case use useEffect hook
eg. 
1] fetch data on component mount.
2] when chat component is visible in UI, connect to chatbot server.
3] interate react with browser api to pause/play video.
