1] putting HTML in javascript.
2] you can put any javascript expression inside {} curley braces in jsx
3] JSX is an Expression Too
After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

JSX Represents Objects
Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.

These two examples are identical:

const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code 
but essentially it creates an object like this:

// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
// here if its a dom tag, type would be string, if its react component class/function it will be that instance.
These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions 
of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to 
construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

jsx -> babel -> React.createElements() -> React elements(json objects) -> React -> construct DOM



// examples
// jsx
const childElement = (<div><span><h1>child</h1></span></div>)
const childElement2 = (<div>child 2</div>)
const parentElement = (
  <div>parent <childElement/> <childElement2 /></div>
)

// babe output of jsx
"use strict";
var childElement = React.createElement("div", null, React.createElement("span", null, React.createElement("h1", null, "child")));
var childElement2 = React.createElement("div", null, "child 2");
var parentElement = React.createElement("div", null, "parent ", React.createElement("childElement", null), " ", React.createElement("childElement2", null));
