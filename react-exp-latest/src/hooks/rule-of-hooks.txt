Functions whose names start with use are called Hooks in React.

Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top 
level of your React function, before any early returns. You can only call Hooks while React is 
rendering a function component:

✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a function component.
✅ Call them at the top level in the body of a custom Hook.
