1] state setter function is called inside event handler
2] when user clicks on button, event handler gets executed. and state setter function is moved to a queue.
3] after all event handlers are executed. react knows that it has state setter function in queue. so it executes state setter 
function from queue. and rerenders the component with new state.
4] component returns a jsx snapshot with event handlers.
5] react calculates the diffs and updates the dom.

7] each render of a functional component, has its own instances of state,props, functions, event handler functions, jsx children.
8] state is readonly during the render. react queues all state updates, runs them after the current render.
and passes the new state as read only input to next render.
