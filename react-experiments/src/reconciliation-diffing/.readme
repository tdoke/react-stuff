1] how DOM works.  === done
2] how browser interprets DOM === done
4] how react component is converted to a tree of react elements
5] what is virtual dom and how it is built from tree of react elements
6] what happens when setState is called on a container / props passed
     to a component change
7] how reconciliation works

reconciliation starts when ReactDOM.render is called or .setState is called in a component, it works in 2 parts
 part 1] build or change virtual dom tree by traversing the tree of react elements generated from root component
 part 2] compare virtual dom with previous virtual DOM find differences
 part 3] commit differences found in step 2] to real DOM.

 optimization: reduce the number of (un necesssary) differences between current virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM
