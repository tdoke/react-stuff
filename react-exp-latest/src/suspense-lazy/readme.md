Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering. Today, Suspense only supports one use case: loading components dynamically with React.lazy. In the future, it will support other use cases like data fetching.

React.lazy() and <React.Suspense> are not yet supported by ReactDOMServer. This is a known limitation that will be resolved in the future.
