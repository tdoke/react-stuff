A ref in react can be used for 2 things
1] to store a value between re-renders.
*ref is plain javascrit object.
*ref.current when value is changed, no rerender is triggered.
*Do not write or read ref.current during rendering, except for initialization. 
This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.
*Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. This means refs are perfect for 
storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, 
if you need to store an interval ID and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update 
the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its current property.
PITFALLS
*Do not write or read ref.current during rendering.
*You can read or write refs from event handlers or effects instead.
USE CASES:
1] to store previous value of a prop or state.
2] to store some cleanup value like interval id.





2] to manipulate DOM of an element.
